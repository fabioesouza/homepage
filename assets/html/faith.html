            <p>I am a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. I was baptized at the age of 8 by my father, Francisco Souza.<br><br>
                I served as a missionary from 2005 to 2007 in the beautiful city of Rio de Janeiro.<br><br>
                I married my wife Fernanda Souza in 2008 at the Curitiba Temple. Two of our sons, Pedro and André, chose to be baptized at the age 8, in 2018 and 2020. Our third son, Tiago, is getting ready for baptism next year.<br><br>
                All my greatest joys are associated with my family and my faith.<br><br>
                I believe that we are children of God. I believe that he sent Jesus Christ to pay for our sins. I believe that God and Jesus Christ live and that they guide their church through prophets. These beliefs were developed through sincere search followed by simple but undeniable confirmations from the Holy Spirit.
