BYU MBA
<p>Before my MBA, I worked several years with product development. With this background, and the experience acquired during my MBA program I am eager to move a step ahead and work as a product manager.</p>
<p>The MBA program prepared me with a complete vision to run a P&L, including operations, leadership, organization behavior, marketing, finance, and accounting. Additionally, I am pursuing a certificate in Product Management comprising classes such as market research, technical product management and entrepreneurial innovation. Finally, I will also receive a minor in Information Systems, considering all the tools and technologies I studied to be able to navigate well the tech world (html, sql, vba, tableau, powershell, bash, and others).</p>
<p>Besides my in-class learning, I had two internship experiences that were extremely valuable and complementary to each other.</p>

Amano Technologies: Start-up developing pools and spas smart chemistry monitoring device
<p>During one month I was able to experience the fast paced and resource-limited environment of a start-up in the prototyping phase of their product. I developed failure mode, effects and criticality analysis identifying and mitigating 150+ risks for this new product.</p>

Dell Technologies: Portfolio management team for software defined data storage solutions
<p>I had the opportunity to go to Austin, TX, for 10 weeks for a fantastic learning experience. In a large corporation, the complexity of the organization chart, the culture, and the established methods add an extra layer of challenges for a new employee. This is the environment I am more used to and I feel extremely motivated in it. During the internship, I created a dashboard to facilitate the strategic prioritization of most impactful features for a specific product line.</p>

What is Product Management?
<p>The discipline of product management is the intersection among the customers, the business and the technology. This means that product managers need to have the ability to connect sales, designers and engineers to deliver a successful product strategy. I'm excited to join this field.</p>
